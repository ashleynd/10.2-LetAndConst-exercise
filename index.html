  <title>Let & Const</title>
</head>

<body>
  <ol>
    <li>The difference between var and let is var is old, not updated for updated behaviors in code. Let can be reassigned but not redeclared. van can be redeclared accidentally, causing confusion. </li>
    <li>const means CONSTANT. Cannot be redeclared and or reassigned. Var CAN be. And they work in different scopes: var is in a function scope, and const is in a block scope.</li>
    <li>const should be the go-to, it is the most consistent. Does not allow to be reassigned or redeclared. let could be accidentally reassigned, and cause confusion.</li>
    <li>Hoisting is where variables are used before they are declared. The variable needs to be within its scope in order for it to run. </li>
